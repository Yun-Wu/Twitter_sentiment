    In this project, we address the issue of sentiment analysis of twitter messages. 
    We collect three corpora from different domains and propose several pre-processing steps based on the nature of the corpus.    
Features based model and      
Recursive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) 
are evaluated by extensive experiments. 
Experiment results indicate that RNTN model works better on well formatted text and feature-based model performs better on general topic tweet. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on twitter sentiment analysis which accounts sentence structure.
