\section{Introduction}

Microblogging websites (such as Twitter, Weibo) have gained popularity in recent years. People can easily post real time, short message to express their opinions. 
Sentiment of microblog is of particular interest because such information is valuable to both consumer andmanufactures.

Most of existing works are based on bag of words classifiers. People propose and evaluate different features to improve the performance of bag-of-words model. Such classifiers can work well in longer documents by relying on a few words with strong sentiment such as "great" or "awesome". However, such bag-of-words models have difficulties in handling in negation and comparisons. Negation and comparison involves the structure of sentence which clearly is not in the scope of bag-of-words models. To further improve the performance, new models which capture the structure of sentences are needed.
