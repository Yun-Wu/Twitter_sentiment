\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this project, we evaluate both feature-based and RNTN models on the task of twitter sentiment analysis. With the same setup, RNTN model performs better than feature-based model. However, due to the lack of the annotated corpus (parse tree with sentiment label) over twitter messages, RNTN model has worse performance than feature-based model on sentiment decision over general topic tweets. Domain adaptation of RNTN model from movie reviews to twitter messages gives no significant improvement.
